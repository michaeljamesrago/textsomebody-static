      <h4>What is TextSomebody?</h4>
      <p>
        TextSomebody is a web application that allows a user to initiate a text-message 
        conversation with any SMS-enabled device, and to share the contents of that 
        conversation through a unique url.
      </p>
      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      <p>
        TextSomebody is built with Rails 7, and makes use of ActionCable, Rails' 
        websocket API, to simulate the real-time feel of a text-message conversation. 
        It depends on Twilio's API for sending and receiving messages.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/textsomebodydiagram.png">
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <h5>Creating a Conversation</h5>
      <p>
        When a user submits a valid phone number through the form at the application's 
        root path, three things happen:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A new conversation resource is created in the database</li>
        <li>A cookie is set on the user's browser, identifying them as the creator of 
        this conversation</li>
        <li>The user is redirected to the url where the new conversation is displayed</li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/textsomebodydemo2.gif">
      </div>
      <p>
        At this point, the new conversation is just a blank space. Now it's time to create 
        some messages for it.
      </p>
      <h5>Sending Messages</h5>
      <p>
        The user's view of the conversation will display the form they'll use to create 
        new messages.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/textsomebodydemo3.gif">
      </div>
      <p>
        Notice that the new message appears in the conversation without a page reload. 
        If we were relying only on the HTTP request/response cycle, the user would have 
        to refresh the page every time they wanted to check for new messages. But using 
        websockets, our server updates the page every time a new message is added to the 
        conversation, without the user having to do anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a couple of steps we need to take in order to use websockets. First, we 
        use an Active Record Callback in our Message model. This will allow us to specify 
        an action to be taken at a particular point in the lifecycle of an Active Record 
        Object. In this case, whenever a new message is saved and committed to the 
        database, we want to broadcast it over a channel identified by the conversation 
        that message belongs to.
      </p>
      <div class="ms-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaeljamesrago/9eaab6d278f7e5018b50d769932ae02b.js?file=textsomebody_code_snippet1.rb"></script>      
      </div>
      <p>
        Next, we need to make sure that any client viewing a conversation is subscribed 
        to the channel that carries that conversation's new messages. We do this by adding 
        the <code>turbo_stream_from</code> tag to the view template.
      </p>
      <div class="ms-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaeljamesrago/9eaab6d278f7e5018b50d769932ae02b.js?file=textsomebody_code_snippet2.rb"></script>
      </div>
      <p>
        By default, when the client receives the broadcast, it will look to append the new 
        message to an element with an id of "messages". If there isn't one on the page, 
        nothing will happen. So we must make sure the parent element of the rendered 
        messages is appropriately named.
      </p>
      <div class="ms-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaeljamesrago/9eaab6d278f7e5018b50d769932ae02b.js?file=textsomebody_code_snippet3.rb"></script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now the message has been created, joined to its parent conversation, and displayed 
        on the page. But to actually send it as an SMS message, we need to integrate our 
        application with the Twilio API.
      </p>
      <h5>Integrating the Twilio API</h5>
      <p>
        To use the Twilio API to send SMS messages, two things are required. First, you must 
        register with Twilio and obtain account credentials. Second, you need a Twilio phone 
        number to serve as the "from" number.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the account credentials and phone number in hand, the most convenient way to 
        use the Twilio API in a Ruby application is to install the <code>twilio-ruby</code> 
        gem and use the Client wrapper class. For this to work, you mu<a class="nav-link active" href="./contact.html">Contact</a>st make the account 
        credentials accessible through environment variables, specifically 
        <code>TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID</code> and <code>TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN</code>. We've set 
        <code>TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER</code> as an environment variable as well. 
      </p>
      <div class="ms-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaeljamesrago/9eaab6d278f7e5018b50d769932ae02b.js?file=textsomebody_code_snippet4.rb"></script>
      </div>
      <p>
        We want to invoke this code every time a new message is added to the database. Therefore, 
        it makes sense to put it in the create method of the MessagesController. However, each 
        message is sent to one and only one "to:" number, which is owned by the Conversation to 
        which that message belongs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering this, we decided to extract the Twilio code to a method defined on the 
        Conversation model, which is invoked in the Message#create method.
      </p>
      <div class="ms-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaeljamesrago/9eaab6d278f7e5018b50d769932ae02b.js?file=textsomebody_code_snippet5.rb"></script>
      </div>
      <h5>Receiving Messages</h5>
      <p>
        When we send a message with TextSomebody, it will appear on the recipient's device as 
        having come from the number designated in our environment variables as 
        <code>TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER</code>. Naturally, when they reply, this is also the number 
        their reply will be sent to. What happens when they reply to that number?
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the features of Twilio's Programmable SMS API is that it can send a webhook to 
        a specified URL every time a message is received by a Twilio phone number. To take 
        advantage of this, we set up a route in our app specifically for webhooks generated by 
        incoming messages, and a controller to handle requests for that path.
      </p>
      <div class="ms-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaeljamesrago/9eaab6d278f7e5018b50d769932ae02b.js?file=textsomebody_code_snippet6.rb"></script>
      </div>
      <p>
        We are interested in two properties of the webhook's payload: <code>From</code> and 
        <code>Body</code>. The <code>From</code> property is the phone number the incoming 
        message was sent from. This is what we use to find the conversation this message should 
        be associated with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>Body</code>property is the text of the message itself, which is added to the 
        database in the same way that outgoing messages are. As soon as the transaction is 
        committed, the new message is broadcast over the conversation's channel, so that anyone 
        viewing the conversation will see it updated with the new message in real time.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/textsomebodydemo4.gif">
      </div>
      <h5>Sharing a Conversation</h5>
      <p>
        Conversations and their messages are publicly accessible, so sharing a conversation is 
        as easy as sharing its url. However, the ability to add new messages to the conversation 
        through the web interface is available only to the conversation's creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated above, when a user submits a new phone number, a cookie is set in their browser 
        identifying them as the creator of the new conversation. This allows us to conditionally 
        render the form that submits new messages.
      </p>
      <div class="ms-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaeljamesrago/9eaab6d278f7e5018b50d769932ae02b.js?file=textsomebody_code_snippet7.rb"></script>
      </div>
      <p>
        If the cookie is not present, or if the encrypted id in the cookie does not match the 
        id of the conversation the user is trying to view, they will not see the new message form.
      </p>
